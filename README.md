The video tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on using String Catalog for localization.

## Localization with String Catalog
**What is String Catalog?**

In SwiftUI, String Catalog is a structure that allows you to manage text in different languages for your application. It is more readable and user-friendly compared to traditional .strings files.

- **Steps for Localization:**

  - Create a String Catalog: Create a String Catalog in Xcode by selecting "New File."
  - Add Languages: Add the languages you want to support to the String Catalog.
  - Define Keys and Values: Enter translations for your text in each language.
  - Use in Code: Call the text in your SwiftUI code using Text("Message").
 
```swift
Text("Message")
```
